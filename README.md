# CS 415 Project for Group 26

Our project documents are available in our [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wzchosGKJnrJ2zeX--myFMdTTXkdx_MGQIDyNZxqwCs/edit) folder, available to @illinois.edu accounts.

For the time being, some resources are not included in the repository. After users `clone` this repository, they must then add the [Assetsville Town](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/assetsville-town) pack to their library, then add it to this project in order for it to work.
